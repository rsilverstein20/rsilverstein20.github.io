                <p>I am a sophomore student at <a href="https://business.wisc.edu"> the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Business</a> intending on majoring in Real Estate and Finance with a Digital Studies Certificate. Last summer I had an internship at a Property Management firm where I was given my first introduction to the real estate industry. My career goal is to combine my creative background and self-motivated attitude with the skills I am learning in the Wisconsin School of Business. I am currently seeking a summer internship opportunity to help further enhance my knowledge of the world of Commercial Real Estate or Finance.</p>
