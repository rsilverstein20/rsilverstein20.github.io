    		<h1>My Artistic Side!</h1>
    		<nav>
    			<p> Aside from my business background and leadership skills, I would also be an asset to whatever group I am a part of because of my creativity and ability to think outside the box. Below show my photography skills that I acquired through my AP Photography class and sneakers I painted when I ran my own sneaker-painting business called Swish Sneaks in high school. Because of this business, I learned a lot about the business world at a young age, and now understand that business and art have a lot more in common than I anticipated. The satisfaction I get from completing a quality art piece is the same satisfaction I get from solving a financial problem. Enjoy my work!</p>
